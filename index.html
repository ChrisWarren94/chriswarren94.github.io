            <h1>Five Beginner Questions About Programming Languages </h1>
            <p>One of the greatest joys of working as a technical writer is the sheer variety of subject matter areas you can work in. Technical documentation is necessary in a wide variety of industries, ranging from medical devices to recycling companies to transportation. Some technical writers have never worked in “tech” companies that produce software.</p>
            <p>However, if you are hoping to become a technical writer at a tech company, you will likely need to familiarize yourself with the basics of coding and programming. If you are exploring these subjects for the very first time, it can be hard to know how to get started. There are so many languages and concepts to learn! </p>
            <p>This guide addresses five questions that people often have when they are first learning how to code. If you are a technical writer who has never coded before, you have come to the right place. </p>

            <h2 id="coding-vs-programming">What is the difference between coding and programming?</h2>
            <p>Essentially, <i>coding</i> involves writing individual lines of code that computers can understand. <i>Programming</i> involves organizing immense quantities of code to achieve a specific goal, or create a computer program to fulfill a specific function.  </p>
            <p>Imagine a website or a computer program as a house. Programmers are architects who draw
            up plans for the house, determine what function each room will have, and generally oversee the project from concept to execution. Coders are craftsmen who bring the
            programmer’s ideas to life by building the individual components of the house. The two
            roles are distinct, but they can overlap. Sometimes programmers write code themselves,
            and many coders know how to program applications.  </p>
