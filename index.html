      <h1>Five Beginner Questions About Programming Languages</h1>
      <p>
        One of the greatest joys of working as a technical writer is the sheer
        variety of subject matter areas you can work in. Technical documentation
        is necessary in a wide variety of industries, ranging from medical
        devices to recycling companies to transportation. Some technical writers
        have never worked in “tech” companies that produce software.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you are hoping to become a technical writer at a tech
        company, you will likely need to familiarize yourself with the basics of
        coding and programming. If you are exploring these subjects for the very
        first time, it can be hard to know how to get started. There are so many
        languages and concepts to learn!
      </p>
      <p>
        This guide addresses five questions that people often have when they are
        first learning how to code. If you are a technical writer who has never
        coded before, you have come to the right place.

      <h2 id="coding-vs-programming">
        What is the difference between coding and programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Essentially, <i>coding</i> involves writing individual lines of code
        that computers can understand. <i>Programming</i> involves organizing
        immense quantities of code to achieve a specific goal, or create a
        computer program to fulfill a specific function.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a website or a computer program as a house. Programmers are
        architects who draw up plans for the house, determine what function each
        room will have, and generally oversee the project from concept to
        execution. Coders are craftsmen who bring the programmer’s ideas to life
        by building the individual components of the house. The two roles are
        distinct, but they can overlap. Sometimes programmers write code
        themselves, and many coders know how to program applications.
