     Five Things Every Technical Writer Should Know About Coding
    </h1>
    <p>
     One of the greatest joys of working as a technical writer is the sheer
           variety of subject matter areas you can work in. Technical documentation
           is necessary in a wide variety of industries, ranging from medical
           devices to recycling companies. Some technical writers have never worked
           in “tech” companies that produce software.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, if you are hoping to become a technical writer at a tech
           company, you will likely need to familiarize yourself with the basics of
           coding and programming. If you are exploring these subjects for the very
           first time, it can be hard to know how to get started. There are so many
           languages and concepts to learn!
    </p>
    <p>
     This guide addresses five questions that people often have when they
           are first learning how to code. If you are a technical writer who has
           never coded before, you have come to the right place.

     1). What is the difference between coding and programming?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Although the  terms “coding” and
           “programming” are often used interchangeably, there are some
           fundamental differences between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
     Coding
     refers specifically to the act of writing and debugging lines of code.
     Programming
     is a more comprehensive process that
     involves producing and organizing large amounts of code to create a
           product
     that
     achieves a specific goal. In addition to writing and debugging
           code, a programmer is also involved in other stages in the software
           development process, including planning, designing, deploying, and
           maintaining the software applications being developed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Imagine a website or a computer program as a house. Programmers are
           architects who draw up plans for the house, determine what function each
           room will have, and generally oversee the project from concept to
           execution. Coders are craftsmen who build the individual components of
           the house. The two roles are distinct, but they can overlap. Sometimes
           programmers write code themselves, and many coders know how to program
           applications.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2 id="h.s2h147m495h9">
     2). Which languages should I start with?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Although specific knowledge requirements may differ from job to
           job, a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will likely
           serve you well in a variety of roles.
    </p>
    <p>
     HTML and CSS are called “markup” languages, and they
           determine how information will be structured and displayed on a webpage.
           They differ from true programming languages in that they don’t
           contain any algorithms, logic, or instructions that tell a computer what
           to do. They merely tell the browser how to display a specific page.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      HTML
      is used to determine a webpage's basic structure. If a
             webpage is a house, HTML is the wooden beams that hold the house up:
             it doesn’t perform many special functions, but most webpages
             need the structure it provides.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      CSS
      is used to design the aesthetics of a webpage, like font styles,
             borders, and background colors. Returning to the house metaphor, CSS
             is like the paint on the house’s walls: it gives the webpage its
             visual personality.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     JavaScript, on the other hand, is considered a true programming
           language.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      JavaScript
      is used to program some of the tasks a webpage performs.
             JavaScript is comparable to the electrical wiring of a house. If you
             flip a light switch in your house, the electrical wiring ensures that
             the bulb above your head is turned on. Similarly, when you click a
             button on a webpage, it is likely JavaScript that is telling the
             webpage how to respond.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     These are just three of the most common languages that you are likely
           to engage with. You may also encounter C, C++, C#, Git, Python, SQL and
           XML during your work as a technical writer.
    </p>
    <h3 id="h.p7cb5e2j7492">
     3). Why are there so many languages?
    </h3>
    <p>
     Different programming languages have different strengths and weaknesses
           for different tasks. Some are better for building websites or mobile
           applications, and some are better for analyzing data. Coders and
           programmers deliberately select the best language for the specific task
           they are trying to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let’s return
     to the house analogy one more time
     .
     M
     any different materials can be used to build different parts of a
           house. Architects choose different materials for different jobs based on
           what the materials most excel at, and the result they are trying to
           achieve. They might use cement to set the foundation of a house, but use
           brick and mortar when building the house’s walls. Similarly, a
           coder might use HTML to build the basic structure of a webpage, but use
           CSS to set up the webpage’s visual aesthetic.
    </p>
    <h3 id="h.lrc4fktgryu1">
     4). What languages are being used in the document I’m looking at
           right now?
    </h3>
    <p>
     HTML
     is being used to determine the basic structure of the webpage.
           For example, the text you are reading right now is formatted as a
           paragraph because of an HTML tag,
     &lt;p&gt;.
     The title of this section is rendered as a heading because we have
           labeled it with an HTML “heading” tag,
     &lt;h2&gt;
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the stylistic elements of this document were also coded using
           HTML instead of CSS. For example, the words “coding” and
           “programming” in Question #1 are italicized because they
           were given an &lt;i&gt; tag in the HTML, which italicizes the text.
    </p>
    <p>
     However,
     CSS
     is being used to determine most of the colors, sizes and styles of the
           font. The text you are reading now appears in the font style
           “Roboto” because of the CSS code
     font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif.
     The CSS code
     font-weight: 100
     determines the size of the font.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally,
     JavaScript
     is being used to run the Table of Contents at the top of the
           page. If you want to navigate to a section on this page immediately
           rather than scrolling down, you can click one of the links in the Table
           of Contents section.
     <sup>
      <a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">
       [a]
      </a>
     </sup>
     <sup>
      <a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">
       [b]
      </a>
     </sup>
     Rather than creating the Table of Contents manually, a simple
           JavaScript function creates a link for each heading in the text.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you would like to see the code for this document yourself,
           right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect” from
           the menu that appears.
    </p>
    <h2 id="h.6md1mc42k5sl">
     5). I keep seeing job listings that mention “API
           documentation” and “end user documentation?” What do
           these terms mean?
    </h2>
    <p>
     API documentation and end user documentation are two different types of
           technical writing.
     A key difference
     is the technical writer’s intended audience.
    </p>
    <p>
     “End user” is another word for “consumer.” When
           you buy a piece of software for your computer or phone, you are the end
           user of that software. The instructions that come with the software,
           such as a guide for installing it on your computer or learning how to
           use it, constitute end user documentation. Well-written end user
           documentation usually should not require the user to be tech-savvy or
           have a background in computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
     By contrast, API documentation teaches developers how to use a specific
           type of software known as an Application Programming Interface (API). An
           API is usually used to enable two different pieces of software to
           communicate with each other. Information about APIs and their functions
           is usually only necessary for software developers, so API documentation
           is written for developers rather than for end users.

      Not quite, but it was a simple change. It would have been possible to
             create the TOC using only HTML, but I would have had to manually
             create an entry for each section heading. Instead, the JavaScript
             finds every &lt;h2&gt; tag in the text and creates a link in the TOC
             for that section.
