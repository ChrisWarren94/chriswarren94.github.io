          Five Things Every Technical Writer Should Know About Coding
        </h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          One of the greatest joys of working as a technical writer is the sheer
          variety of subject matter areas you can work in. Technical
          documentation is necessary in a wide variety of industries, ranging
          from medical devices to recycling companies. Some technical writers
          have never worked in “tech” companies that produce software.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you are hoping to become a technical writer at a tech
          company, you will likely need to familiarize yourself with the basics
          of coding and programming. If you are exploring these subjects for the
          very first time, it can be hard to know how to get started. There are
          so many languages and concepts to learn!
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide addresses five questions that people often have when they
          are first learning how to code. If you are a technical writer who has
          never coded before, you have come to the right place.

        <h2 id="coding-vs-programming">
          1. What is the difference between coding and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Although the  terms <em>coding</em> and <em>programming</em> are often used
          interchangeably, there are some fundamental differences between the
          two.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coding</strong> refers specifically to the act of writing and
          debugging lines of code.
          <strong>Programming is a more comprehensive process</strong> that
          involves producing and organizing large amounts of code to create a
          product that achieves a specific goal. In addition to writing and
          debugging code, a programmer is also involved in other stages in the
          software development process, including planning, designing,
          deploying, and maintaining the software applications being developed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine a website or a computer program as a house. Programmers are
          architects who draw up plans for the house, determine what function
          each room will have, and generally oversee the project from concept to
          execution. Coders are craftspeople who build the individual components
          of the house. The two roles are distinct, but they can overlap.
          Sometimes programmers write code themselves, and many coders know how
          to program applications.
        </p>
        <h2 id="which-language-to-start">
          2. Which languages should I start with?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Although specific knowledge requirements may differ from job to job, a
          basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will likely serve you
          well in a variety of roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML and CSS are called <em>markup</em> languages, and they determine how
          information will be structured and displayed on a webpage. They differ
          from true programming languages in that they don’t contain any
          algorithms, logic, or instructions that tell a computer what to do.
          They merely tell the browser how to display a specific page.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML</strong> is used to determine a webpage's basic
            structure. If a webpage is a house, HTML is the wooden beams that
            hold the house up: it doesn’t perform many special functions, but
            most webpages need the structure it provides.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS</strong> is used to design the aesthetics of a webpage,
            like font styles, borders, and background colors. Returning to the
            house metaphor, CSS is like the paint on the house’s walls: it gives
            the webpage its visual personality.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          JavaScript, on the other hand, is considered a true <em>programming</em>
          language.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is used to program some of the tasks a
            webpage performs. JavaScript is comparable to the electrical wiring
            of a house. If you flip a light switch in your house, the electrical
            wiring ensures that the bulb above your head is turned on.
            Similarly, when you click a button on a webpage, it is likely
            JavaScript that is telling the webpage how to respond.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are just three of the most common languages that you are likely
          to engage with. You may also encounter C, C++, C#, Git, Python, SQL
          and XML during your work as a technical writer.
        </p>
        <h2 id="so-many-languages">3. Why are there so many languages?</h2>
        <p>
          Different programming languages have different strengths and
          weaknesses for different tasks. Some are better for building websites
          or mobile applications, and some are better for analyzing data. Coders
          and programmers deliberately select the best language for the specific
          task they are trying to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s return to the house analogy one more time. Many different
          materials can be used to build different parts of a house. Architects
          choose different materials for different jobs based on what the
          materials most excel at, and the result they are trying to achieve.
          They might use cement to set the foundation of a house, but use brick
          and mortar when building the house’s walls. Similarly, a coder might
          use HTML to build the basic structure of a webpage, but use CSS to set
          up the webpage’s visual aesthetic.
        </p>
        <h2 id="languages-in-this-document">
          4. What languages are being used in the document I’m looking at right
          now?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong> is being used to determine the basic structure
          of the webpage. For example, the text you are reading right now is
          formatted as a paragraph because of an HTML tag,
          <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. The title of this section is rendered as a
          heading because we have labeled it with an HTML “heading” tag,
          <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the stylistic elements of this document were also coded using
          HTML. For example, the words “coding” and “programming” in
          <a href="#coding-vs-programming">section 1</a> are bolded because they
          were given an <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag in the HTML, which tells
          your browser to format the text as bold.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CSS</strong> is being used to determine most of the colors,
          sizes and styles of the font. The text you are reading now appears in
          the font style “Roboto” because of the CSS code:
        </p>
        <div class="codesample">
          <pre>
body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  }</pre
          >
        </div>
        <p>
          Finally, <strong>JavaScript</strong> is being used to run the Table of
          Contents at the top of the page. If you want to navigate to a section
          on this page immediately rather than scrolling down, you can click one
          of the links in the Table of Contents section. Rather than creating
          the Table of Contents manually, a simple JavaScript function creates a
          link for each heading in the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to see the code for this document yourself,
          right-click anywhere on the page and select <em>Inspect</em> from the
          menu that appears.
        </p>
        <h2 id="API-end-user-docs">
          5. I keep seeing job listings that mention
          <em>API documentation</em> and <em>end user documentation</em>. What
          do these terms mean?
        </h2>
        <p>
          API documentation and end user documentation are two different types
          of technical writing. A key difference is the technical writer’s
          intended audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>End user</strong> is another word for <em>consumer</em>. When
          you buy a piece of software for your computer or phone, you are the
          end user of that software. The instructions that come with the
          software, such as a guide for installing it on your computer or
          learning how to use it, constitute end user documentation.
          Well-written end user documentation usually should not require the
          user to be tech-savvy or have a background in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast, <strong>API documentation</strong> teaches developers how
          to use a specific type of software known as an
          <em>Application Programming Interface</em> (API). An API is usually
          used to enable two different pieces of software to communicate with
          each other. Information about APIs and their functions is usually only
          necessary for software developers, so API documentation is written for
          developers rather than for end users.
